# "Cheat Your Neighbour": a card game for those who like to bluff and find out your opponent's tricks

This game can be played by any number of participants.

The object of the game is to be the first to get rid of all your cards.

The cards are divided equally between the players. The first player lays one to four cards face down and declares their value, e.g. all cards are sevens.

The next player chooses:
- Place one to four cards face down and declare them to be of the same suit. In this case, it is the next player's turn. If all the players have done the same, the first player in the circle no longer has the option of placing cards on top, but must choose between 'believe' and 'disbelieve'.
- Believe. If the cards are guessed - the entire pile is sent on a discard pile. If the cards are not guessed, he takes the entire pile.
- Disbelieve. If correct, the previous player takes the entire pile. If he is wrong, he takes the whole pile.
If the player is right, he makes a move. If he is wrong, it is the next player's turn.

By agreement, players may add two jokers to the game. Jokers can be announced by any card other than themselves. For example, you can lay up to six cards and declare that they are all queens.
