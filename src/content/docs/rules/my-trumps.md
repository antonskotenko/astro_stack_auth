# My game, my trumps
 
«My Trumps» is a traditional Russian card game with a unique feature that sets it apart from other similar entertainment. Here, each player plays with his own trumps. A player chooses the suit of his trumps before starting a new game.
 
The object of the game is to be the first to discard all your cards.
 
Rules of the game:
 
A deck of cards is dealt to each player. When a player lays a card, the next player must cover it with a card of the highest suit or his trump card. Cards are ranked from sixes to aces.

If a player is able to cover a card, it remains in the common pile and it is the winning player's turn to place a card on top of the pile. This continues until someone can't cover their opponent's card, in which case that player takes the whole pile. The first player to get rid of all their cards wins.
