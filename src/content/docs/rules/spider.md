# Spider Solitaire, when you want to play alone

"Spider" is a single player card game. It encourages the development of strategic thinking and helps to train your brain and attention.

The object of the game is to collect cards by suit in descending order from King to Ace in the least number of moves.

Rules of the game:
1. There are 54 cards on the table in 10 rows. The cards remaining after the deal are in the closed stock pile. Only the top cards in each column are revealed.
2. Open cards are moved to the next highest card, regardless of suit. When open cards are moved, the closed cards underneath them are revealed.
3. To create a sequence, cards are moved to the next highest card of the same suit. The highest card in the sequence is the King, followed by the Queen, Jack, 10 and so on up to the Ace.
4. Sequences are moved according to the same rules as face up cards.
5. Any open card or sequence of cards of the same suit can be placed on an empty space.
6. When the moves are over, the player adds one open card from the stock pile to each column, and so on until the stock pile is exhausted.
 
There are three difficulty levels in the game:

- For beginners - one suit (spades).
- For amateurs - two suits (spades and hearts).
- For professionals - four suits.
