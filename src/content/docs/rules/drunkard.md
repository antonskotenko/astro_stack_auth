# Drunkard: try your luck!

Drunkard is a simple Russian card game. Your victory here depends largely on your fortune.

The object of the game is to take all the cards in the deck.

Rules of the game:

The lowest card is a deuce in a 52-card deck, or a six in a 36-card deck. Only the lowest cards beat the ace.

The game begins with the cards being dealt face down to the players. One player reveals his first card and places it on the table. The second player also reveals his card. The player with the higher card takes both cards and places them at the bottom of his pile.

If both players lay cards of the same value, there is a dispute. Then each player must lay two more cards: one closed and one open. The player with the highest open card takes all the cards from the table. If a player has only one card left, the dispute continues, but without the closed card. The player who has no cards left to continue the dispute takes all the cards of the dispute. The player who has all the cards at the end of the game wins.
