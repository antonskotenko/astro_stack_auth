# Klondike, Solitaire, Kosynka - three names for the same game

Klondike is a card game that originated in Alaska during the gold rush, after which it was officially named. In Russia it is better known as 'Kosynka' solitaire, which means 'kerchief' because the shape of the card layout resembles a triangular kerchief. And the name Solitaire game acquired in the 80s of the last century, when it was first released under this name as part of the Windows operating system and became very popular. It's worth noting, however, that solitaire isn't actually the name of a single game, but a generic name for single-player card games.

The object of the game is to sort cards by suit in descending order.

Rules of the game:

The cards are laid out on the table in the shape of a triangle. You can move them one at a time to a higher-ranking card of the opposite suit, in descending order from King to Deuce. A pile of cards remaining after the deal is placed next to it. They can be brought into play using the same rules. Note that only the king can be moved to an empty cell. In the top right-hand corner is a base for placing aces and complete card sequences.
